# Thoughts & Opinions - This is not a Blog

## 2020-11-01: Regarding youtube-dl

I've aired my opinion on DRM and DMCA elsewhere. In my opinion, anti-circumvention laws are essentially thoughtcrime laws, especially if they seek to prohibit the free exchange of information (about unjust and nonsensical systems built by humans in furtherance of unfair business models that would otherwise not be viable, and which are being protected by such laws as if they were sacred, handed down by gods).

Cowardly decisions regarding freedom of speech (and I'm not talking about criminal activity or hate speech!) make a platform obsolete. Acts of censorship, if one wants to call it that, on behalf of the US copywrong mafia aren't about anything genuinely objectionable - I'd understand that, I really would. By banning development of youtube-dl from your platform, you're joining the fight against the sharing of knowledge. That's why I can only call upon everyone to move any FLOSS repositories away from github because they might fall prey to similar decisions.

Whoever isn't fighting for the users has made their standpoint clear (unsurprising, what else has M$ ever been doing?). And so is mine. No thoughtcrime, no copyright, and FLOSS get the hell away from big platforms.

Meanwhile, I do appreciate that some action has now been taken on behalf of legitimate users and youtube-dl is back.

My principal objection now goes towards DMCA itself, which your lawmakers would be well-advised to abolish because of its many harmful implications.

And now there's [this](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/critics-fume-after-github-removes-exploit-code-for-exchange-vulnerabilities/). More reasons to think twice before thinking of hosting one's code on the largest platform. What if this policy becomes more prohibitive in the future? Just like in the youtube-dl case it doesn't even have to be the platform's fault. Legislative overreach, criminalizing technical information deemed too sensitive for the public, such as "hacker tools", is rife.

## 2020-06-06: Regarding the new "device notification" mails

Regarding [this](https://github.community/t/new-security-feature-device-verification/10216).

"Please verify your device" mails: harmless nonsense or harbingers of more confusion and suckage? You be the judge.

I do not want every online sevice to become as unusable as home banking in the EU after the introduction of the awful PSD-2 directive (which, as you may know, introduces great "security features" such as unpredictable TAN confirmations for queries that aren't even transactions, and mandates that online banking websites log the user out after 5 minutes of presumed "inaction" for "security reasons" - just to prevent customers from dealing with the bank's website according to their own needs, incidentally breaking accessibility for disabled users!)

The idea that services are at liberty to model, profile and scan the user or their "devices", whatever that is supposed to mean, is inacceptable and must be nipped in the bud.

The recent invention of "Please verify your device" confirmation mails does not bode well for the direction that user experience with github and other sites is taking. Spurred by this recent flurry of new and unnecessary "security theatre"-like ideas cropping up everywhere, I have composed the following complaint:

**Subject: UX: "device verification" should be optional**

When I log in, I always get a "Please verify your device" email with a Verification code.
This is an annoying, time consuming and unnecessary extra step as far as I am concerned.

It does not add any security for me. I reject the notion of logging in with a "device" that you are at liberty to profile. You are not at liberty to profile my client or my network connection. I have a philosophical issue with the very wording, because it confuses the layers: do not log in with a "device"; I log in with credentials. From a system that's as secure as it can be, and whose compromise would already be the greatest imaginable accident.

I could use 2-FA but that's not the right trade-off for me. I have no reason to be especially worried about my credentials being stolen. Please don't try and impose a one-size-fits-all security model on everyone. Please let that be my concern, my decision. Please don't break things that work, in the name of a one-size-fits all notion of "security".

You've certainly seen the discussions. I agree. Let it be the default for new users, but make it optional. There's no reason not to.
